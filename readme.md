# tv show scraping assessment assignment

Produced in a short duration of time for purpose of assessing programming skill

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
nodejs
typescript
```

### Installing

clone the repository and run `npm install`

after that you can compile and run the project with `npm start`.

## Tests

Due to time constraints tests have not been included, but care has been taken to slice everything into neat little components that can be tested by themselves

## Comments

My philosophy regarding comments is that variables and function names need to be named aptly so there is no need to have large comment blocks preceding every function, which would make sense if you're using automated documentation generation though.

## Typescript

As you might have noticed the code is mostly javascript with little typescript added. I have worked with typescript before but I haven't set up a project with it before so this is the most I could do in the time I could spend.
